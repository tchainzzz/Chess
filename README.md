This is a basic chess engine in Java that I've been working on, based on a tutorial series with my own improvements and additions, named BOTvinnik after the former world chess champion and computer chess pioneer.

This is a work in progress. I currently plan on refining the minimax algorithm and debugging the board representation/GUI.
